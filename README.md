    abstract = "Idioms, integral to any language, convey nuanced meanings and cultural references. However, beyond English, few resources exist to support any meaningful exploration of this unique linguistic phenomenon. To facilitate such an inquiry in a low resource language, we introduce a novel dataset of Nepali idioms and the sentences in which these naturally appear. We describe the methodology of creating this resource as well as discuss some of the challenges we encountered. The results of our empirical analysis under various settings using four distinct multilingual models consistently highlight the difficulties these models face in processing Nepali figurative language. Even fine-tuning the models yields limited benefits. Interestingly, the larger models from the BLOOM family of models failed to consistently outperform the smaller models. Overall, we hope that this new resource will facilitate further development of models that can support processing of idiomatic expressions in low resource languages such as Nepali."
